        <h2 class="card-title text-center"><strong> Managing Money&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p class="card-text text-justify">As a young adult, you are likely to have moved out of home to pursue your education. For those who are still living at home while doing so, you will likely be living a more independent life compared to your secondary schooling life. Among some of the new skills you will need to master will be, of course, financial savvy-ness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="card-text text-justify">Whether you are paying your own way, receiving parent’s help, using financial aid, or a little of all three, college is an expensive experience that becomes pricier with poor spending practices. College students often collect debts quickly. As with any adult, if debt is not managed well, you will face a lot of hardship trying to settle your debts instead of having a fulfilling young adulthood.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="card-text text-justify">What causes some college student debts to rack up more quickly than others? Generally, it falls to lack of financial awareness and poor money management. However, these are easily overcome if you take the effort to learn about your current financial situation and instill practical yet reasonable money management habits. With this in mind, we provide you with a few financial tips to survive in college years. </p>
        <p class="card-text text-justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 class="card-text text-justify text-capitalize"><strong>&nbsp;1. Create a detailed budget</strong></h4>
<p class="text-justify">&nbsp;Carefree high school students frequently spend whatever is in their bank account, living off their parents’ generosity or the spoils of a part-time job. Once that student moves away to college, a budget becomes crucial.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Whether or not you have been exposed to a budget, it’s important that you sit down to look at finances. Map out your various streams of income, including money from parents, income from a part-time job, and money coming from student loans, grants, and other types of financial aid. Then, categorize your expenses you know where it’s all going. Maybe, in the beginning, you can’t force yourself to stick to a budget but you can feel confident because now, you have a clear picture of what is and isn’t affordable.</p>
        <h4 class="text-justify text-capitalize"><strong>&nbsp;2. Build a Small Emergency Fund</strong></h4>
<p class="text-justify">&nbsp;An emergency fund is a pot of money you keep to the side for a rainy day. When you have a little extra money, put it towards an emergency fund. This fund protects you if you ever have to deal with an immediate or urgent financial emergency.</p>
        <h4 class="text-justify text-capitalize"><strong>&nbsp;3. Minimize Student Debt</strong></h4>
<p class="text-justify">&nbsp;There are several ways to minimize student debt. One of them is to spend financial aid on the right things. Even if loans look like “free money” now, they do come back to bite you. Tuition, books, housing, food should be your upmost priorities instead of weekly social outings or loads of new outfits.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Consult with your parents if you want a credit card and they can help you choose the best one together. Freshmen should never sign up for a student credit card on a whim. Instead, you can discuss the pros and cons of different cards, set a reasonably low spending limit, and look for cards with points or cashback rewards. </p>
        <h4 class="text-justify text-capitalize"><strong>&nbsp;4. Earn extra money with a part-time job</strong></h4>
<p class="text-justify">&nbsp;If you want to fund other needs and/or your social life, it should be done with income from a part-time job, rather than with money taken out of your student loans. Work-study positions on campus like research assistants usually offer the flexibility a student needs with the convenience of location, while off-campus positions usually pay more. Either way, it is better to pay now for non-essential purchases so that you don’t really need to pay for them later.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="text-justify">But, keep in mind that your part-time job shouldn’t interfere with your main purpose as a student – to study. Good time management is crucial when you are balancing between studying and working part-time. </p>
        <h4 class="text-justify text-capitalize"><strong>&nbsp;5. Set Financial Limits</strong></h4>
<p class="text-justify">&nbsp;One way to help your spending is to implement financial limits for unnecessary items. Setting a spending limit doesn’t necessarily prevent you from making impulse purchases, but it should give you a pause to assess whether or not the new iPhone is really necessary. By setting a fairly low limit – say, RM400 – RM800 per month – you will have some restriction when it comes to spending power. Add the non-essential money into your proposed budget or emergency fund, separate from essential expenses such as gas and food.</p>
